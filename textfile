Virtual reality is a simulated experience that employs 3D near-eye displays and pose tracking to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment, education and business. VR is one of the key technologies in the reality-virtuality continuum.







1. Immersive Presence
Immersive presence in virtual reality refers to the feeling of being physically present in a
virtual environment. This effect is achieved through a combination of stereoscopic displays,
motion tracking, and real-time rendering, which work together to trick the brain into
perceiving a digital world as real.
2. Difference Between Desktop VR and Mobile VR
• Desktop VR: Requires a high-performance computer with a powerful GPU, often
connected to a tethered headset like the Oculus Rift. Provides better graphics, lower
latency, and more processing power.
• Mobile VR: Runs on smartphones, using headsets like Google Cardboard or Gear VR.
It is more portable and affordable but offers lower graphics quality and limited
interactivity due to less powerful hardware.
3. Choosing Between Oculus Quest 2 and Google Cardboard
• Oculus Quest 2: A standalone VR headset with built-in tracking, high-resolution
displays, and powerful hardware for immersive experiences.
• Google Cardboard: A budget-friendly VR solution that works with smartphones,
offering a basic VR experience.
• Best Choice: If budget and portability are priorities, Google Cardboard is a good
entry-level option. However, for a more immersive, high-quality experience, Oculus
Quest 2 is the better choice.
4. Essential Hardware Tools
• Head-Mounted Display (HMD) (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive)
• Motion Tracking Hardware (e.g., IMU sensors, cameras)
• Input Devices (e.g., game controllers, hand-tracking sensors like Leap Motion)
• Computing Platform (e.g., high-performance PC or mobile device).
5. Most Important 3D Coordinate Transformations • Translation: Moving objects along
the x, y, or z-axis.
• Rotation: Rotating objects around an axis.
• Scaling: Changing the size of an object in 3D space. These transformations are
typically represented using 4×4 transformation matrices.
6. Optimizing 3D Models for VR
• Reduce Polygon Count: Use fewer vertices and faces to improve performance.
• Optimize Textures: Use compressed textures and efficient mapping techniques.
• Level of Detail (LOD): Adjust detail levels based on object distance from the camera.
• Efficient Lighting: Minimize dynamic lights and use baked lighting when possible.
7. VR Input System
• Game Controllers: Xbox, PlayStation controllers.
• Hand Tracking: Leap Motion, Oculus Touch controllers.
• Body Tracking: Full-body tracking with systems like STEM by Sixense.
8. Haptic Feedback and Audio Cues
• Haptic Feedback: Provides physical sensations through vibrations or resistance in
controllers.
• Audio Cues: Spatial audio enhances immersion by adjusting sound based on the
user’s head position.
9. Causes of Motion Sickness in VR
• Latency: Delay between user movement and visual update.
• Field of View (FOV) Issues: Mismatch between real-world and VR peripheral vision.
• Mismatch Between Visual and Vestibular Systems: Discrepancy between what the
eyes see and what the body feels.
10. Performance Optimization Techniques
• Reduce Rendering Load: Use lower-poly models and efficient shaders.
• Optimize Frame Rate: Target at least 60 FPS, ideally 120 FPS.
• Asynchronous Time Warp (ATW): Predicts head movement to reduce latency.
• Occlusion Culling: Prevents rendering objects not visible to the user.
Based on the museum:
Here's how the VR concepts apply to your virtual museum tour
application:
1. Immersive Presence in a Virtual Museum
Your goal is to make users feel as if they are physically inside the
museum. This is achieved through:
• High-quality 3D models of museum interiors and artifacts.
• Stereoscopic rendering to create a sense of depth.
• Real-time motion tracking so users can look around naturally.
• Spatial audio to provide realistic sound effects and guide
users through the museum.
2. Desktop VR vs. Mobile VR for the Museum Tour
• Desktop VR (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive) o Ideal for high-end
experiences with detailed 3D models and smooth
interactions.
o Requires a powerful PC, limiting accessibility.
o Best for museums that want a premium, on-site VR
experience.
• Mobile VR (e.g., Google Cardboard, Oculus Quest 2 in
standalone mode) o More affordable and accessible, allowing
users to experience the tour at home.
o Uses pre-rendered scenes or cloud streaming to reduce
processing demands.
o Best for wider audience reach but with lower visual
fidelity.
3. Choosing Between Oculus Quest 2 and Google Cardboard
• Oculus Quest 2:
o Allows free movement and hand tracking, making the
museum tour interactive.
o Higher graphics quality and built-in spatial audio for
immersion.
o Best for fully interactive museum tours.
• Google Cardboard:
o Low-cost, requiring only a smartphone.
o Best for a simple, passive experience (e.g., 360degree
images with audio).
o Ideal for users who just want to "look around" rather
than interact.
Recommendation: If you want users to explore and interact, go
with Oculus Quest 2. If you want a wider audience at low cost,
Google Cardboard works.
4. Essential Hardware Tools for the Virtual Museum To create and
test your VR museum, you'll need:
• VR Headsets (Oculus Quest 2 for interaction, Google
Cardboard for mobile).
• Motion Controllers for selecting exhibits and interacting with
objects.
• High-performance PC (for developing and rendering museum
scenes).
• 3D Modeling Software (e.g., Blender, Maya, Unity) to design
museum exhibits.
5. Most Important 3D Coordinate Transformations
• Translation: Moves an exhibit to a different location (e.g.,
repositioning a statue).
• Rotation: Rotates an object so users can view artifacts from
different angles.
• Scaling: Adjusts the size of artifacts to fit within the museum
layout.
• Matrix Transformations: Used to animate objects, like
opening a museum door.
6. Optimizing 3D Models for VR Performance
Since VR performance is critical, you need to:
• Reduce polygon count for museum models without losing
quality.
• Use texture baking instead of real-time lighting to improve
speed.
• Implement Level of Detail (LOD) to load lower-poly versions of
objects when far away.
• Optimize shaders and shadows to avoid lag.
7. VR Input System for the Museum
Visitors should be able to interact with exhibits using:
• Hand tracking (Oculus Quest 2) to pick up objects.
• VR controllers to teleport, point at artifacts, and navigate.
• Gaze-based selection (Google Cardboard) for mobile users,
allowing them to "stare" at an exhibit to activate audio
descriptions.
8. Haptic Feedback & Audio Cues
• Haptic feedback:
o Vibrations when touching artifacts to simulate texture.
o Subtle feedback when pressing virtual buttons.
• Audio cues:
o Spatial audio to guide users through the museum.
o Interactive narration for each artifact triggered when
users get close.
9. Motion Sickness & How to Prevent It
Common causes of motion sickness in VR museums:
• Latency (slow response to movement).
• Inconsistent frame rates (target 90 FPS or higher).
• Rapid camera movements (use smooth locomotion or
teleportation instead).
• Narrow field of view (FOV) causing disorientation.
Solution: Implement gradual acceleration, stable horizon lines, and
avoid sudden motion.
10. Performance Optimization Techniques
To keep the VR museum smooth and immersive:
• Optimize rendering: Use occlusion culling (only render objects
in view).
• Reduce texture sizes: Compress textures to improve load
times.
• Use baked lighting: Avoid real-time lighting to save GPU
power.
• Limit physics interactions: Reduce unnecessary physics
calculations.

Reduce Latency
What is Latency?: Latency is the delay between a user’s movement and the corresponding update in the VR display. High latency can cause disorientation and nausea.

How to Prevent It:

Ensure the VR system has a low latency (ideally under 20 milliseconds).

Use high-performance hardware (e.g., powerful GPUs and CPUs) to process movements quickly.

Optimize software to minimize rendering delays.

2. Maintain Consistent Frame Rates
Why Frame Rates Matter: Low or inconsistent frame rates can cause stuttering, which disrupts immersion and leads to motion sickness.

How to Prevent It:

Target a minimum of 90 FPS (frames per second) for smooth visuals.

Use frame rate smoothing techniques like asynchronous timewarp (ATW) or spacewarp to maintain smoothness even during performance drops.

Optimize 3D models and textures to reduce rendering load.

3. Avoid Rapid Camera Movements
Why Rapid Movements Cause Issues: Sudden or unnatural camera movements can confuse the brain, as they don’t match the body’s sense of motion.

How to Prevent It:

Use teleportation as a movement mechanic instead of smooth locomotion.

If smooth locomotion is necessary, implement gradual acceleration and deceleration to mimic natural movement.

Avoid camera shake or sudden jumps in perspective.

Provide a fixed reference point (e.g., a virtual nose or cockpit) to ground the user.

4. Optimize Field of View (FOV)
Why FOV Matters: A narrow FOV can make users feel confined, while an overly wide FOV can cause distortion and disorientation.

How to Prevent It:

Use a natural FOV (around 90-110 degrees) to balance immersion and comfort.

Avoid dynamically changing the FOV during gameplay or exploration.

Provide options for users to adjust the FOV to their preference.

5. Implement Stable Horizon Lines
Why Horizon Lines Matter: A stable horizon helps the brain maintain a sense of balance and orientation.

How to Prevent It:

Keep the horizon line level and consistent during movement.

Avoid tilting the camera unnecessarily (e.g., simulating head rolls or uneven terrain).

Use fixed reference points in the environment (e.g., a horizon line or static objects).

6. Use Comfortable Movement Mechanics
Why Movement Mechanics Matter: Poorly designed movement systems can cause disorientation and nausea.

How to Prevent It:

Teleportation: Allow users to instantly move to a new location without continuous motion.

Blinkers or Tunneling: Reduce peripheral vision during movement to minimize sensory conflict.

Smooth Locomotion with Comfort Settings: Add options like snap turning, reduced speed, or vignetting during movement.

7. Provide User Control and Customization
Why User Control Matters: Different users have different tolerance levels for VR motion.

How to Prevent It:

Offer adjustable settings for movement speed, turning, and comfort features.

Allow users to enable or disable specific features (e.g., smooth turning vs. snap turning).

Include a comfort mode for sensitive users.

8. Design Environments for Comfort
Why Environment Design Matters: Cluttered or disorienting environments can exacerbate motion sickness.

How to Prevent It:

Use clear and intuitive layouts to guide users naturally through the space.

Avoid excessive visual noise or overly complex textures.

Ensure lighting and shadows are consistent and realistic.

9. Educate Users
Why Education Matters: Users may not be aware of best practices for avoiding motion sickness.

How to Prevent It:

Provide onboarding tutorials to teach users how to use VR comfortably.

Encourage users to take breaks every 15-30 minutes.

Warn users about potentially disorienting experiences (e.g., rollercoaster simulations).

10. Test and Iterate
Why Testing Matters: Motion sickness can vary greatly between individuals, so testing is crucial.

How to Prevent It:

Conduct user testing with a diverse group to identify discomfort triggers.

Gather feedback and iterate on design and mechanics.

Use analytics to track user behavior and identify problematic areas.

Additional Tips for VR Museums
Static Viewing Areas: Allow users to explore exhibits from fixed points rather than moving continuously.

Guided Tours: Provide pre-recorded or guided tours with smooth, controlled camera movements.

Comfortable Seating: Encourage users to sit while using VR to reduce disorientation.

Chapter 4: Going Mobile: Developing for Gear VR
This chapter focuses on developing applications for the Samsung Gear VR, which is described as the flagship mobile VR device on the market.
•
Hardware Overview:
◦
Gear VR is a partnership between Oculus and Samsung.
◦
It's a custom headset that houses a smartphone with a high-resolution display.
◦
Initially released as an "Innovator Edition," it works with specific phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 and S6 lines. The price, including a new phone, could be around US$800 to US$1,000 at the time of writing, which is considered a pricey option.
◦
It features high-resolution graphics, thanks to phone displays like the Note 4's 2560 x 1440 pixels (1280 x 1440 per eye).
◦
The headset includes a custom IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) based on Oculus technology that tracks motion much faster and with less latency than the phone's built-in IMU.
◦
Input controls are built into the headset, including an eye adjustment wheel, volume control, headphone jack, and a touchpad for touch input.
•
Oculus Home:
◦
Gear VR features an innovative user interface called Oculus Home for discovering, launching, and installing mobile VR applications.
◦
Oculus Home provides a fully immersive interface, allowing users to browse and launch apps without removing the headset. This provides an uninterrupted VR experience, including seeing system alerts from the phone while inside VR.
•
Development:
◦
Developing for Gear VR's Android-based operating system requires the Oculus Mobile SDK.
◦
This SDK must be used alongside the standard Android SDK. Setting up the Android SDK and enabling USB debugging on the target device are necessary steps.
◦
The chapter focuses on using the Unity3D game engine for development, similar to desktop Oculus Rift development.
◦
While Unity is recommended for its features, particularly for games and VR, native Android development is also possible using libraries like GearVRf, an open source Java framework created by Samsung.
◦
Using Unity involves importing the Unity Integration package from the Oculus Mobile SDK.
◦
The chapter provides steps for building and running a sample Unity application (the Cubes scene) on a Gear VR device. This includes setting up the Build Settings in Unity for the Android platform and adding the scene to the build.
◦
Building creates an Android package (.apk) file that is deployed to the phone. Once the phone is placed in the Gear VR headset, the application runs, providing stereo rendering and head tracking.
◦
Key VR concepts from desktop development, like stereo rendering and head tracking, translate directly to mobile.
◦
The OVRCameraRig prefab from the Unity Integration package provides the necessary stereo rendering and head tracking support. It contains child objects representing camera anchors for the left and right eyes.
◦
The OVRManager script is the main interface to the Oculus Mobile SDK in Unity, handling communication with the native SDK and updating camera properties like field of view and aspect ratio for each eye. For Gear VR, the main update logic runs in the Update() method of the OVRCameraRig script.
◦
The chapter also covers handling touchpad input using another SDK prefab, OVRPlayerController, which uses touchpad events for camera movement.
◦
Implementing gaze tracking for selecting objects is discussed as another important VR input technique. An example using a crosshair is mentioned, combining gaze with touchpad input for selection.
◦
Basic steps for deploying applications to Gear VR are outlined, including signing the application with a valid Android signature file and submitting it to the Oculus Store.
◦
Developing for Gear VR is noted as potentially tricky due to Android setup, Unity complexities, and deployment quirks, but Gear VR is seen as a major step toward consumer-grade, mass-market virtual reality.
Next, here's a breakdown of Chapter 5:

















Chapter 5: WebVR: Browser-Based Virtual Reality in HTML5
This chapter explores WebVR, which allows creating virtual reality experiences that run directly in web browsers using HTML5.
•
Motivation for WebVR:
◦
Building VR experiences as web applications offers several advantages over native applications:
▪
Instant access: No app download or installation required; experiences can be launched via a URL or hyperlink.
▪
Easy integration of web data: Simple access to information from sites like Wikipedia, YouTube, social networks, and thousands of open web services via APIs.
▪
Cross-platform: HTML5 runs on desktop and mobile devices, and HTML5 code can be delivered via browsers or embedded in apps.
▪
Faster, cheaper development: Uses open source tools (mostly free) and arguably the easiest cross-platform system (HTML5, JavaScript).
•
The Story of WebVR:
◦
WebVR originated from collaboration starting in spring 2014 between Mozilla engineers Vlad Vukićević and Josh Carpenter, and Google Chrome engineer Brandon Jones.
◦
Their goal was to add Oculus Rift support to Firefox and Chrome with a native browser implementation to avoid performance issues from older plugin-based methods.
◦
They quickly collaborated to create a common API so developers could write code once and run it in both browsers, marking the birth of WebVR. This collaboration is highlighted as a testament to the power of web standards and open community development.
•
WebVR API Basics:
◦
The WebVR API allows developers to access VR device capabilities within the browser. Note that the API discussed here is distinct from the methods used for Google Cardboard mobile browser apps, which are covered in Chapter 6.
◦
A key step is querying for connected VR devices using functions like navigator.getVRDevices() (with cross-browser support for navigator.mozGetVRDevices). This function uses JavaScript promises.
◦
The API identifies device types like HMDVRDevice (for the display) and PositionSensorVRDevice (for head tracking). These are saved for later use.
◦
Developers can check if the WebVR API is available by testing if the query function exists.
◦
The API supports setting up VR Fullscreen Mode on an HTML5 canvas element, often using browser-prefixed methods like mozRequestFullScreen() or webkitRequestFullscreen(). The HMD device is passed to this method to indicate VR fullscreen is desired.
•
Creating a WebVR Application Example:
◦
Building a WebVR application involves combining HTML5, JavaScript, and WebGL, often using a library like Three.js. While the web offers many open source tools, they may not be as polished as native development systems like Unity or Unreal.
◦
A simple example application demonstrates rendering a cube texture-mapped with the WebVR logo in stereo, responsive to headset movement. It includes a button to enter VR fullscreen mode.
◦
Running local web examples requires a web server.
◦
The application's structure involves an HTML page with elements for the button and a container for the WebGL canvas.
◦
JavaScript libraries, including Three.js and its WebVR extensions like THREE.VREffect (for stereo rendering/fullscreen) and THREE.VRControls (for camera control based on head tracking), are included via script tags. These extensions were developed by the Mozilla VR team.
◦
The main JavaScript program initializes Three.js, sets up VR rendering, creates the 3D scene content, sets up VR camera controls, and runs a run loop.
◦
The initVREffect() function configures stereo rendering and fullscreen handling using the THREE.VREffect object.
◦
The initScene() function creates the 3D objects, such as the cube, using Three.js geometry and materials.
◦
The run loop is the heart of the application, using the browser's requestAnimationFrame() function to drive continuous animation and rendering.
◦
Within the run loop, the scene is rendered for each eye using effect.render(), camera controls are updated based on device orientation using controls.update(), and scene elements (like the cube) can be animated.
•
Tools and Techniques:
◦
Besides Three.js, other WebGL engines and development tools are available for creating WebVR, although they are still maturing.
◦
Game engines like Unity3D and Unreal have added WebGL export capabilities. This export uses a technology called Emscripten to cross-compile engine code to asm.js (low-level JavaScript), providing high frame rates but potentially resulting in very large initial download sizes.
◦
Other open source JavaScript 3D libraries like BabylonJS (which has a specific WebVR camera object) and GLAM (a declarative language for 3D web content) are also available.
◦
Mozilla's MozVR showcase site features demos and research related to WebVR.
•
Conclusion:
◦
WebVR is described as new and experimental but holds tremendous potential due to open collaboration and leveraging existing web infrastructure.
◦
It could potentially change not only VR development but also the future of web browsing.
